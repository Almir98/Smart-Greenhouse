# Smart-Greenhouse (ASP .NET MVC and IoT project)

Final thesis at the Faculty of Information Technology Mostar.
Primarily an Arduino project with temperature and humidity sensor, a light sensor, a fan and motors that will simulate opening windows. By increasing the temperature in the greenhouse, Arduino motors automatically open the windows and the fan starts to work in order to refresh the air in the interior of the greenhouse. Also if the light level inside the greenhouse is insufficient for the growth of some type of vegetable, the light sensor detects this and automatically turns on the light in the greenhouse to simulate the operation of the assimilation lamp. The Arduino collects data from sensors then the data is stored in a database. ASP .NET MVC application that serves a professional person to display graphical and tabular data for a period of time collected from arduino sensors stored in a database.

## Images:
#### 1. Create a chart based on the measured temperature values from the sensor Arduino

#### 2. In addition to the graph, there is a tabular display of values for easier readability. You can open spreadsheets in Excel or print them out if you need to.
